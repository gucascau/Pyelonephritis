## Sptaial map of mouse Pyelonephritis 

# Introduction

Pyelonephritis is caused by bacteria that enter the kidneys through the bloodstream or from the ureter, which is the tube that connects the bladder to the kidneys.

# Description
In this project, we generated a comprehensively high resolution map of mouse kidney remodeling after bacteria infections within different dates.
